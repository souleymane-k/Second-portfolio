        <h2>Hello! I'm souleymane Kone.</h2>
        <p>I would like to introduce myself to give you a better understanding of my person. I live in pinole California which is 23 miles from San Francisco. Currently, I’m managing a non-profit organization which operates in rural Africa especially in the Ivory Coast. We fight against chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Our actions aim to provide diabetes test kits and other anti-inflammatory medicines such as Tylenol, Ibuprofen. Besides, we work with local physicians and nurses who provide medical services allowing hundreds of people to have access to medical care. Better, we work with pharmacists who provide us with prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>To reach this level of activity, we work with stakeholders who provide financial assistance to pay for expenses. We work also with other non-profit organizations and government agencies to implement our projects.</p>

Also, I have developed friendships with people invested in software development. I live in an environment where we have developed a community of web developers. Therefore, I'm willing to share ideas on new projects and work with other software developers.</p>

  <h2>Know Your Numbers</h2>
  <p>This project consists of helping diabetes patients to input their data in an application that will output whether or not their glycemic level is normal or not.  There will be three groups of people such as normal glycemic level, prediabetic group, and diabetes group. The output can show a descriptive graph with different colors. For the normal level of blood glycemia,  the app will show the result in the integer number and the corresponding color, which will be green. The color yellow will be affected by prediabetes value and finally red for diabetic output. At least two tests will be performed every day: one before eating and the second one after eating.</p>
